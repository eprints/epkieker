=head1 NAME

Kieker::Controlling - Provides Controlling mechanisms to Kieker Modules

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Kieker::Controlling;
 my $control = Kieker::Controlling->instance();   # Get controlling instance

 my $trace = $control->getTrace();                # Get current traceID

 my $orderId = $control->getOrderIndex($trace);   # Get current orderIndex

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides controlling methods for Kieker. The main functions are
providing consistent trace and orderIDs. When new traces are created the 
corresponding traceEvents are created and written.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $control = Kieker::Controlling->instance();

Returns the singleton instance of Kieker::Controlling. If no instance is defined
a new instance is created.

=cut

my $oneTrueSelf;

sub instance {
  # check singleton
  unless (defined $oneTrueSelf) {
    my ($type) = @_;
    my $this = {};
    
    $oneTrueSelf = bless $this, $type;
  }
  return $oneTrueSelf;
}

=head2 my $orderId = $control->getOrderIndex($trace);

Returns the current orderIndex and increments the count. If this is the first 
request a new traceEvent is created and written to the log.

=cut

sub getOrderIndex {
  my ($self, $trace) = @_;
  
  if (defined ($self->{$trace})) {
    my $orderIndex = $self->{$trace} + 1;
    $self->{$trace} = $orderIndex;
    return $orderIndex;
  } else {

#    my $kieker_writer = Kieker::Writer::JMSWriter->instance();
#    my $kieker_record = Kieker::Record::TraceMetaData->new($trace);
#    $kieker_writer->write($kieker_record->genoutput());
    $self->{$trace} = 0;

    return $self->{$trace};
  }
}

=head2 my $trace = $control->getTrace();

Returns the current traceID. In this version it uses the threadID and relies on
special Apache configuration.

=cut

sub getTrace {
  return $$;
}

=head1 BUGS

The package is probably full of bugs and is likely to break on every possible
occasion. If you find any please let me know via email.
